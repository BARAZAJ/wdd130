        <p> My name is Baraza John. I am from a city called Jinja, in Uganda. 
            I am currently pursuing my second degree from Brigham Young University, Idaho. 
            I already hold a BS in applied Business Management. 
            I'm now trying to complete a BS in Software development. I love learning new stuff, especially challenging stuff like coding. </p>

        <img src="Images/jinja.jpg" alt="Jinja City Landscape">
        <p> Jinja is a city in eastern Uganda. It is located on Africa largest lake - lake Victoria. It is located 
            right on the spot where the world's longest river, the Nile, meets Africa's largest lake. It is commonly known as 
            "the adventure capital of East Africa" because of its robust and thrilling tourism activities. It is where the Nile starts its long journey to Egypt.
            It is a blend of urbanization and natural beauty.
