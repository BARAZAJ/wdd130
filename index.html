        <img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="BARAZA JOHN" width="200px" >
        <p> My name is Baraza John. I am from a city called Jinja, in Uganda. 
            I am currently pursuing my second degree from Brigham Young University, Idaho. 
            I already hold a BS in applied Business Management. 
            I'm now trying to complete a BS in Software development. I love learning new stuff, especially challenging stuff like coding.
        I am an outdoors person. I love spending time hanging out with friends. My city makes this an easy hobby. It provides 
    a lot of outdoor activities and beautiful nature. I work as a marketing manager though I feel there's still a lot that I need To
explore before I can comfortably settle in one career.I am also taking courses with google. I am studying to become an I.T support 
specialist. I also intend to go to the Marriot School of Business for a Masters of Business Administration degree. It feels like 
I have a lot to learn in such a sort lifetime. I am a religious person and I believe the Lord will guide me in the path that he wants 
me to take. I am a returned missionary who continues to serve the Lord in any possible way I can.  </p>
